# Project 2 Evaluation

Nice work on completing a working full-stack application! Please review my [inline code comments here](https://github.com/marasanders/Wedding-Planner/compare/master...nolds9:feedback)

## Technical Requirements
**2: Performing**
>The app contains 2 models, with at least 1 association. At least 1 model is full CRUD.

## Creativity and Interface
**1: Progressing**
>The app is styled and has an interface of value to the end user: it is not just a nav bar and an index page

## Code Quality
**1: Progressing**
>Code lacks proper formatting, includes commented out, non-functional code, or otherwise contains major issues of quality (DRY, naming, etc)

## Deployment and Functionality
**2: Performing**
>Application contains no major errors, is deployed correctly, and contains a custom Heroku app name appropriate for the app.

## Planning / Process / Submission
**1: Progressing**
>App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality and link to deployed application
